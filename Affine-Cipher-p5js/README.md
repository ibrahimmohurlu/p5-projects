# Affine Cipher Test
The **affine cipher** is a type of monoalphabetic substitution cipher, where each letter in an alphabet is mapped to its numeric equivalent, encrypted using a simple mathematical function, and converted back to a letter. The formula used means that each letter encrypts to one other letter, and back again, meaning the cipher is essentially a standard substitution cipher with a rule governing which letter goes to which. As such, it has the weaknesses of all substitution ciphers. Each letter is enciphered with the function (ax^n + b) mod 26, where b is the magnitude of the shift.

This project implements the **Affine Cipher** algorithm and gives oppurtunity to test **Affine Cipher** algorithm with different function parameters and encrypt text.
